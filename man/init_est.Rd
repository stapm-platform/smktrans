\title{Cohort specific smoking initiation}
\usage{
init_est(data, strat_vars = c("sex", "imd_quintile"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data table of individual characteristics. Must contain 'start_age'.}

\item{strat_vars}{Character vector of stratification variables (e.g., "sex", "imd_quintile").}
}
\value{
A summarized data.table of initiation probabilities by age/year/cohort.
}
\description{
Reconstructs longitudinal smoking histories from cross-sectional recall data.
It expands each individual's record into a time-series of 0s (non-smoker)
and 1s (initiation event).
}
\details{
This function avoids row-wise looping for speed. It uses an "expansion"
approach where we create a grid of all possible ages and join the
events to it.
