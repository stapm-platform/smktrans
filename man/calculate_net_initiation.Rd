\title{Calculate Net Initiation Probabilities (Synthetic Cohort)}
\usage{
calculate_net_initiation(init_data, quit_data, relapse_data, pops, config)
}
\arguments{
\item{init_data}{Data.table. Initiation probabilities.}

\item{quit_data}{Data.table. Quit probabilities.}

\item{relapse_data}{Data.table. Relapse probabilities (must contain 'time_since_quit').}

\item{pops}{Data.table. Population weights.}

\item{config}{List. Must contain 'country' and uncertainty params ('kn', 'kn_samp', 'kR').}
}
\description{
Calculates "Net Initiation" probabilities by simulating a synthetic cohort 
starting at age 12. This metric represents the net flow into the "Current Smoker" 
state (Initiation + Relapse - Quitting) relative to the non-smoking population 
at each age.

It solves the issue where high initiation rates at young ages are offset by 
high quit rates (experimentation vs. established smoking).

\details{
\strong{Assumptions:}
\itemize{
  \item The cohort starts at age 12 with 100% Never Smokers.
  \item Relapse probabilities are selected based on age-specific assumptions about 
        average time since quitting: 
        (12-17: 1yr, 18-24: 3yrs, 25-30: 5yrs).
