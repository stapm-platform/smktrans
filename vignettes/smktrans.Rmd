The `smktrans` package is the engine room for estimating the probabilities that individuals will move between different smoking states—specifically initiation, cessation, relapse, and death—within the Sheffield Tobacco Policy Model (STPM).

This article outlines the philosophy behind these estimates, the methodology used to generate them, and their history of use in informing UK government policy.

## Living Estimates: A Versioned Approach

It is important to understand that the transition probabilities provided by `smktrans` are **not static**. 

Smoking behaviour is dynamic, and our understanding of it evolves as new survey data becomes available and methodological refinements are made. Therefore, this package operates on a versioned basis:

* **Updates:** When new health survey data is released or when we refine our algorithms, the package version is incremented.
* **Snapshots:** Each version of the package produces a specific set of estimates. 
* **Access:** You can download the specific probability estimates for England, Scotland, and Wales from the **Articles** tab on this website. 

We recommend always checking the package version to ensure you are using the most current estimates for your modelling work.

## Methodology

The estimates produced by `smktrans` are not the direct result of calibration or fitting a standard statistical model (e.g. a logistic regression for prediction). Instead, they result from applying a mathematical algorithm that is based on a **rearrangement of the formula for the dynamics of smoking prevalence**. See the [Sheffield Tobacco Policy Model Technical Documentation](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FR7WN).

### The Framework
The foundation of this methodology is the work by **Holford et al. (2014)** for the United States. They established a workflow for estimating smoking state transition probabilities from repeat cross-sectional survey data. 



We have adapted this approach for the UK context. The core logic involves taking observed cross-sectional prevalence (the "stocks" of smokers and non-smokers at a specific time) and calculating the necessary flows (transitions) required to maintain or change those stocks, accounting for:

1.  **Mortality:** We integrate external information on disease-specific mortality rates to account for the differential survival of smokers, former smokers, and never smokers.
2.  **Relapse:** We explicitly model the probability of returning to smoking after quitting.
    * **Long-term (>1 year):** Based on *Hawkins et al. (2010)* using the British Household Panel Survey.
    * **Short-term (<1 year):** Derived from the placebo condition in *Jackson et al. (2019)*.

Full technical details can be found in the [STPM Technical Documentation](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FR7WN) and in the methodological vignette found in the articles tab of the smktrans website.

## Impact and Policy Application

The estimates generated by `smktrans` have formed the evidence base for major tobacco control policy decisions in the UK.

### 1. England: The Royal College of Physicians & The SmokeFree Generation
The transition probabilities were originally developed for England. Their first major application was informing the projections for **Section 2.6 of the Royal College of Physicians' 2021 report**, *"Smoking and health 2021: A coming of age for tobacco control?"*

As the President of the RCP noted in the introduction:  
> "Instead, modelling of current tobacco control policies shows a failure to achieve a smoking prevalence of <5% until after 2050."

Following this, the methodology was utilized in a knowledge exchange project with the **Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID)**. The understanding produced by this collaboration later supported the government's internal modelling for the **SmokeFree Generation** policy. 

When the **Tobacco and Vapes Bill** was introduced to Parliament, `smktrans` estimates were used by the government modelling team for the final Impact Assessment.

### 2. Scotland: Minimum Pricing for Tobacco
Funded by the **[SPECTRUM Consortium](https://sarg-sheffield.ac.uk/projects/spectrum/)**, we extended the methodology to Scotland. These estimates informed a report commissioned by **Public Health Scotland** on the potential effects of minimum pricing for tobacco.

### 3. Wales: Knowledge Exchange
Work is currently ongoing to use these estimates for Wales, supported by a commissioned knowledge exchange project with **Public Health Wales**. We have begun to work with their data science team to integrate `smktrans` methodology into their internal analytic workflows.

### 4. Academic Credibility & External Validation
The credibility of `smktrans` estimates extends beyond the University of Sheffield research team. They have been independently adopted by other academic groups to inform peer-reviewed simulation studies. 

Most notably, **Davies et al. (2026)** utilized our estimates to model the potential inequality impacts of the SmokeFree Generation policy in England.

## Future Directions

The `smktrans` estimates continue to evolve. They currently form the backbone of our tobacco pricing modelling using **TAX-sim** (developed under the [NIHR SYNTAX project](https://sarg-sheffield.ac.uk/projects/syntax/)). They have recently informed modelling of the effects of changes to tobacco tax in England: *Read the peer-reviewed publication: Chen et al. (2026) in [Tobacco Control](https://doi.org/10.1136/tc-2025-059670).*  

Furthermore, we are now using these quitting probability estimates as calibration targets for a new **Agent-Based Models (ABM)** designed to understand the behavioural mechanisms underlying quit attempts and maintenance. *Read the peer-reviewed publication: Tian et al. (2026) in [Winter Simulation Conference](https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC63780.2024.10838986).*
